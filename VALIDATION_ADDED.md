# Validation Monitoring Added ✅

## What Changed

### 1. **Train/Val Split**
- Dataset split: **85% train / 15% validation** (fixed seed=42 for reproducibility)
- Train samples: 125,350 patches
- Val samples: 22,121 patches
- Augmentation applied **only to training set**

### 2. **Validation Function**
- Added `validate_epoch()` that runs after each training epoch
- No gradient computation, no denoising noise
- Same loss computation as training for fair comparison

### 3. **Loss Tracking**
Updated loss history to track:
- `train_total`, `train_recon`, `train_kl`
- `val_total`, `val_recon`, `val_kl`
- `capacity` (for monitoring KL capacity schedule)

### 4. **Best Model Selection**
- Now saves best model based on **validation loss** (not training loss)
- Prevents overfitting to training set

### 5. **Progress Display**
New format shows both train and val losses:
```
Epoch   1/20 | Train Loss: 1.2345 | Val Loss: 1.3456 | KL: 12.34/13.45 | β: 0.20 | C: 6.0
```

### 6. **Loss Curves**
Updated plots show train vs val for all metrics:
- Total Loss (train vs val)
- Reconstruction Loss (train vs val)
- KL Divergence (train vs val)

---

## Why This Matters

### Detects Overfitting
- If `val_loss >> train_loss`, model is memorizing training data
- With VAEs + augmentation, gap should stay small

### Fair Model Comparison
- All experiments now evaluated on same held-out validation set
- Better predictor of test set performance

### Early Stopping
- Can stop training when val loss stops improving
- Saves time and prevents overfitting

## Current Training Status

```
✅ Training started: B1 (VAE-Skip96, z=64)
✅ Validation split created: 15% of train data
✅ Monitoring: train/val loss every epoch
⏳ ETA: ~8-10 minutes per epoch, ~20 epochs = ~3 hours
```

### Expected Behavior
- **Early epochs** (β≈0, C≈0):
  - Train/val loss similar (both high)
  - KL near zero (capacity constraint active)
  
- **Mid epochs** (β→1.0, C→60):
  - Loss decreasing
  - KL increasing (following capacity schedule)
  - Train/val gap should stay < 10-20%
  
- **Late epochs** (β=1.0, C→120):
  - Loss stabilizes
  - KL tracks capacity (90-140 nats)
  - Val loss guides best model selection

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch training progress
tail -f experiments/B1_VAE-Skip96-z64/training.log

# Check current epoch
grep "Epoch" experiments/B1_VAE-Skip96-z64/training.log | tail -1

# View loss curves (after epoch 5)
open experiments/B1_VAE-Skip96-z64/reconstructions/loss_curves.png

# View reconstructions (saved every epoch)
ls experiments/B1_VAE-Skip96-z64/reconstructions/recon_epoch_*.png
```

## Key Changes in Code

### `train_vae_experiments.py`
1. Added `from torch.utils.data import random_split`
2. Added `validate_epoch()` function
3. Modified dataset loading to create train/val split
4. Updated training loop to call validation
5. Updated `plot_loss_curves()` to show train/val
6. Changed best model selection to use `val_metrics['loss']`

### Files Modified
- `train_vae_experiments.py`: Added validation logic
- Dataset split: 125,350 train / 22,121 val (fixed seed)

### No Changes Needed
- Model architecture (VAE-Skip96)
- Loss function (capacity scheduling intact)
- Hyperparameters (β, C, denoise, etc.)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for epoch 1 completion** (~8-10 min)
   - Check train vs val loss
   - Verify KL is tracking capacity
   
2. **Monitor train/val gap**
   - Should stay < 20% throughout training
   - If gap > 50%, add more regularization
   
3. **Check reconstructions**
   - Saved every epoch in `reconstructions/`
   - Visual quality check

4. **After 20 epochs**
   - Review loss curves
   - Check best val loss
   - Compare with B2 (β=3.0) next

## Expected Outcomes

### Healthy Training
```
Epoch   1 | Train: 1.234 | Val: 1.267 | Gap: +2.7%  ✅
Epoch   5 | Train: 0.856 | Val: 0.881 | Gap: +2.9%  ✅
Epoch  10 | Train: 0.623 | Val: 0.654 | Gap: +5.0%  ✅
Epoch  20 | Train: 0.512 | Val: 0.548 | Gap: +7.0%  ✅
```

### Overfitting (Bad)
```
Epoch   1 | Train: 1.234 | Val: 1.267 | Gap: +2.7%  ✅
Epoch   5 | Train: 0.856 | Val: 0.991 | Gap: +15.8% ⚠️
Epoch  10 | Train: 0.423 | Val: 0.812 | Gap: +92.0% ❌
```

With our regularization (skip dropout, denoising, capacity), we expect the first scenario!
