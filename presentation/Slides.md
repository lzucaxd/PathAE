The Narrative Arc
Central Story: "Clinical pathologists drown in gigapixel data. We built an AI system that reduces their workload by 75% while maintaining 97% accuracy through intelligent uncertainty-based triage. Our systematic comparison of learning paradigms revealed a fundamental trade-off: better embeddings don't guarantee better localization."

SLIDE-BY-SLIDE BREAKDOWN (Markdown Format)
Slide 1: Title
markdown# Automated Tumor Detection in H&E Histopathology
## A Systematic Study of Learning Paradigms for Clinical Deployment

[Your Name]
Deep Learning Course - CS7150
October 2025

Slide 2: The Clinical Problem (45 seconds)
markdown# The Challenge: Finding Needles in Gigapixel Haystacks

## Clinical Reality
- Pathologists review 50-100 slides per day
- Each Whole Slide Image (WSI): **100,000 × 100,000 pixels**
- That's **10 billion pixels** per slide at 40× magnification
- Critical task: Find sparse tumor regions in mostly normal tissue

## The Data Problem
- WSIs are **massive**: 2-5 GB per slide
- Cannot process entire image at once (memory constraints)
- Real-world: **98.6% of tissue is normal** (extreme imbalance)

**Central Question:**
> Can we build an AI system to reduce pathologist workload 
> while maintaining clinical safety?
Visual: Include your magnification pyramid photo showing levels 0-6
Why this matters: Establishes the computational and clinical challenges upfront.

Slide 3: The Data Pipeline - Handling Gigapixel Images (1.5 min)
markdown# From Gigapixel WSIs to 96×96 Patches

## Multi-Scale Pyramid Structure

[SHOW YOUR PYRAMID PHOTO HERE]

**Magnification Levels:**
- Level 0: 40× (0.25 μm/pixel) - Highest resolution, **gigapixel scale**
- Level 1: 20× (0.50 μm/pixel)
- Level 2: 10× (1.0 μm/pixel) ← **We work here**
- Level 3-6: Lower magnifications for thumbnail viewing

## Why Patchification is Necessary

**Memory constraints:**
- Full WSI at Level 0: ~10 GB in memory
- GPU memory: 16-32 GB typical
- **Solution: Extract 96×96 patches at Level 2**

**Our approach:**
```
WSI (100K × 100K pixels at Level 0)
    ↓
Extract at Level 2 (10× magnification)
    ↓
Grid sampling: 96×96 patches, stride=96 (non-overlapping)
    ↓
~166,000 patches per WSI
    ↓
Record spatial position (row_idx, col_idx) for reconstruction
```

**Why 96×96 at Level 2:**
- Level 2: Captures cellular architecture (nuclei visible, tissue patterns clear)
- 96×96: Balance between context and computational efficiency
- Enough to see multiple cells, not so large that training is prohibitive
Visual: Diagram showing WSI → pyramid → patch extraction → spatial grid
Intent statement:

"We chose Level 2 (10×) specifically because it provides sufficient
cellular detail to distinguish tumor from normal while keeping patches
computationally manageable. Higher magnification (Level 0) would give
nuclear detail but lose tissue architecture context."


Slide 4: Preprocessing Pipeline (1 min)
markdown# Preprocessing: Making Data Model-Ready

## Step 1: Macenko Stain Normalization

**The Problem:**
- H&E staining varies between labs, scanners, protocols
- Hematoxylin (blue, nuclei) and Eosin (pink, cytoplasm) intensities inconsistent
- Models would learn scanner artifacts, not biology

**The Solution: Macenko Normalization**
```
Input RGB → Extract H & E stain vectors → Normalize to reference
```

[SHOW YOUR MACENKO NORMALIZATION FIGURE HERE]

**Impact:** Reduces color variation, improves cross-scanner generalization

---

## Step 2: Biologically Valid Augmentations

**Design Principle:** Only augmentations that preserve H&E biology

### ✅ **Used (Biologically Valid):**
```python
RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5)      # Tissue orientation arbitrary
RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.5)        # Tissue orientation arbitrary  
RandomRotation(degrees=180)      # Full rotation invariance
ColorJitter(
    brightness=0.1,              # ±10% staining batch variation
    contrast=0.1,                # ±10% scanner differences
    saturation=0.05,             # ±5% H&E balance variation
    hue=0.02                     # ±2% (~7°) minimal shift
)
GaussianBlur(kernel_size=3)      # Focal plane variation
```

### ❌ **NOT Used (Breaks Biology):**
```python
RandomGrayscale()     # Destroys H&E color information
RandomErasing()       # Creates artificial holes
Extreme ColorJitter   # Breaks biological meaning
Cutout/Mixup         # Not biologically motivated
```

**Intent:**
> "Every augmentation choice preserves H&E semantics. We augment for 
> technical variation (staining, focus) but never introduce patterns 
> that wouldn't occur in real tissue."
Visual: Before/after examples of augmentations showing they preserve biology

Slide 5: Metric Choice - The Foundation (45 seconds)
markdown# Why PR-AUC? Metrics Must Match the Problem

## The Class Imbalance Reality

**Real WSI distribution:**
- 98.6% normal tissue
- 1.4% tumor tissue

## Metric Comparison on Imbalanced Data

| Metric | "Predict All Normal" | Our Supervised Model |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Accuracy | 98.6% ✓ (misleading!) | 82.8% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.50 (reveals useless) | 0.96 ✓ |
| **PR-AUC** | 0.014 ❌ | **0.96** ✅ |

**Why PR-AUC:**
- Focuses on minority class (tumor) performance
- Penalizes false positives appropriately
- Maps directly to clinical utility: "Can we reliably flag tumors?"

**Secondary Metric: IoU on WSI heatmaps**
- Tests spatial localization, not just classification
- Real-world performance on gigapixel images
Intent statement:

"We chose PR-AUC because it directly measures what matters clinically:
finding rare tumor regions without flooding pathologists with false alarms."


Slide 6: Experiment 0 - The Failure That Focused Our Approach (1 min)
markdown# Experiment 0: Unsupervised Learning (VAE) - Failed ❌

## Hypothesis
> "Train VAE on normal tissue only. Tumor patches will have 
> high reconstruction error → anomaly detection."

## Why We Tried This
- Unsupervised: Don't need labels (cheaper)
- Established method for anomaly detection
- Should detect "abnormal" patterns

## Architecture Attempts
- β-VAE with various strategies
- Standard Autoencoder
- Latent distance methods (Mahalanobis)

## Result: PR-AUC 0.39 (barely better than random)

## Root Cause Diagnosed
**Posterior collapse:** KL divergence → 0, latent space unused

## Critical Insight
> "VAE optimizes for reconstruction fidelity, NOT class discrimination.
> Wrong objective function for our detection task.
> 
> Lesson learned: Detection requires discriminative features, 
> not reconstructive ones."

**This failure focused our approach on supervised discriminative learning.**
Show: One terrible VAE heatmap (noisy, unusable)
Why include this: Shows scientific process, honest about failures, demonstrates learning from mistakes.

Slide 7: Experiment 1 - Supervised Baseline (1.5 min)
markdown# Experiment 1: Supervised Learning - Success ✅

## Architecture Decision: ResNet18 from Scratch

**Why ResNet18 specifically:**
- ✅ Residual connections solve vanishing gradients (proven for deep networks)
- ✅ Right scale: 11M parameters for 96×96 patches
- ✅ Proven architecture for medical imaging

**Why from scratch (no ImageNet pretraining):**
- ✅ Domain shift: Natural images (cats, cars) ≠ H&E tissue
- ✅ Learn task-specific features: Nuclear morphology, tissue architecture
- ✅ Achieved 0.96 PR-AUC - pretraining not needed

## Training Strategy
```python
Loss: BCEWithLogitsLoss        # No focal loss (balanced data)
Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-3)      # Higher for scratch training
Scheduler: CosineAnnealing     # Smooth convergence
Epochs: 16 (early stopping)    # Converged efficiently
```

## Results

**Classification (PCam Test):**
- PR-AUC: **0.96** ✅
- Precision: **97.5%** (very few false alarms)
- Recall: 67.4% (conservative - diagnosed issue)

**Localization (8 WSIs):**
- Mean IoU: **0.52** ✅
- Best slide: 0.81 (excellent!)
- Consistent across 7/8 slides

## Diagnosed Limitation

**Precision-recall trade-off:**
```
High precision (97.5%) BUT low recall (67.4%)
→ Model too conservative
→ Misses 1/3 of tumors (clinical safety issue)
```

**This motivated exploration of contrastive learning for better recall.**
Show: Training curves (smooth convergence) + best heatmap (test_002, IoU 0.81)

Slide 8: Experiment 2 - Contrastive Learning Hypothesis (1.5 min)
markdown# Experiment 2: Can Better Embeddings Improve Performance?

## The Hypothesis

**Observation from supervised model:**
- Feature space silhouette: 0.37 (moderate separation)
- Embeddings show overlap between tumor/normal

**Hypothesis:**
> "Explicit optimization for class separation will produce 
> better embeddings → better performance"

## Architecture
```
ResNet18 Encoder (same as supervised)
    ↓
Projection Head: 512 → 256 → 128 (L2 normalized)
    ↓
Supervised Contrastive Loss
```

**Why projection head:** Separates representation (512d) from contrastive objective (128d)

## Training Strategy: Two-Stage (Intentional!)

**Stage 1 (20 epochs):** Learn embeddings via contrastive loss
**Stage 2 (10 epochs):** Freeze encoder, train linear classifier

**Why two-stage:**
> "Tests embedding quality independently. If linear classifier 
> achieves high performance, embeddings are excellent. 
> Diagnostic approach, not just optimization."

## Embedding Quality Results

| Metric | Supervised | Contrastive | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Silhouette | 0.37 | **0.41** | +10% ✅ |
| Separation Ratio | 1.52 | **1.70** | +12% ✅ |
| Linear SVM Acc | 76% | **88%** | +16% ✅ |

**Hypothesis validated:** Contrastive creates better-separated embeddings!
Show: Your t-SNE comparison (supervised vs contrastive) showing tighter clusters

Slide 9: Contrastive Results - The Trade-off Revealed (1.5 min)
markdown# The Surprising Result: Better Features ≠ Better Performance

## Classification Performance (PCam Test)

|  | Supervised | Contrastive | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR-AUC | **0.96** | 0.95 | -1% |
| Accuracy | 82.8% | **86.9%** | +4.1% ✅ |
| **Recall** | 67.4% | **87.9%** | **+20.5%** ✅ |
| F1-Score | 0.80 | **0.87** | +8.7% ✅ |

**Good news:** Better recall! More balanced predictions.

---

## BUT - WSI Localization Performance

|  | Supervised | Contrastive | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mean IoU** | **0.52** | 0.25 | **-50%** ❌ |
| Best slides | 7/8 | 0/8 | Catastrophic |

## The Critical Insight

> **Better embeddings ≠ better spatial localization**
> 
> Contrastive optimizes: "Is this patch tumor or normal?" (global similarity)
> Clinical need: "WHERE in the slide is tumor?" (spatial precision)
> 
> Linear classifier on frozen features < End-to-end task optimization

## What This Teaches Us

**Fundamental trade-off revealed:**
- Representation learning: Optimizes feature space geometry
- Task-specific learning: Optimizes end objective directly

**For spatial tasks:** Task-specific optimization wins.

**For transfer/clustering:** Representation learning wins.
Show: Comparison table + worst contrastive heatmap (tumor_020, IoU 0.17)
Why this matters: Turns "failure" into research insight about learning paradigms.

Slide 10: Experiment 3 - Ensemble for Clinical Deployment (1 min)
markdown# Experiment 3: Ensemble with Uncertainty Quantification

## The Clinical Requirement

> "Deployment needs more than accuracy - needs CONFIDENCE.
> Pathologists won't trust black-box predictions."

## Our Solution: Ensemble as Uncertainty Metric

**Method:**
```python
Prediction = (P_supervised + P_contrastive) / 2
Uncertainty = |P_supervised - P_contrastive|
```

**Rationale:**
- Combines supervised's precision (97.5%) with contrastive's recall (87.9%)
- Model disagreement = confidence metric
- Simple, interpretable, fast

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | **87.8%** (best overall) |
| PR-AUC | 0.96 |
| Precision | 94.3% |
| Recall | 80.4% |

## Uncertainty Validation: Does It Work?

**Error rate by uncertainty level:**
```
Low uncertainty (<0.1):     2.51% error  ← Safe to automate
Medium (0.1-0.2):           3.65% error
High (0.2-0.3):             5.86% error
Very high (>0.3):          17.42% error  ← Needs expert review
```

**✓ Validated: 7× error rate increase from low to high uncertainty!**

Slide 11: Grad-CAM - What Did Models Learn? (2 min)
markdown# Model Interpretability: Grad-CAM Analysis

## What is Grad-CAM?
Visualizes **which regions** drive model predictions
- Red/Orange: High attention (important for decision)
- Blue/Green: Low attention (ignored)

---

## True Positive: Both Models Correct ✅

**What we see:**
- Dense, crowded purple nuclei (tumor cells)
- Both models: Strong red attention on nuclear regions

**Interpretation:**
> "Models correctly focus on increased nuclear density and 
> irregular chromatin - the actual diagnostic criteria pathologists use.
> Validates biological learning, not memorization."

---

## False Positive: The Key Failure Mode ❌

**What we see:**
- Dense purple nuclei on right side
- Both models: Intense orange/red attention on right side
- Ground truth: This is NORMAL (inflammatory infiltrate)

**Why models fail:**
> "Inflammatory lymphocytes are hyperchromatic and densely packed - 
> biologically mimics tumor cellularity. Both supervised and contrastive 
> focus on identical regions and make identical errors.
> 
> **Critical finding: 65% of our false positives are inflammation.**
> Not random errors - systematic biological confuser."

**Actionable insight:** Need hard negative mining on inflammation

---

## False Negative: Edge Cases ❌

**What we see:**
- Tumor tissue but models predicted normal
- Sparse cellular regions, pink stroma dominates
- Both models: Weak, diffuse attention (low confidence)

**Why models fail:**
> "Sparse tumor cells at patch edges - trained on centered, dense patches.
> Models require high cellularity to trigger tumor classification.
> 
> **53% of false negatives are sparse/edge tumors.**"

**Actionable insight:** Need multi-scale context (larger receptive field)

---

## Supervised vs Contrastive Attention

**Nearly identical patterns despite different training!**
- Validates: Both discovered same biologically relevant features
- Explains: Why ensemble works - disagreement is meaningful

Spend time here: This is your interpretability showcase.

Slide 12: Clinical Deployment Strategy - The Triage System (1 min)
markdown# From Research to Deployment: Uncertainty-Based Triage

## The 3-Tier System

### Tier 1: Auto-Decidable (Uncertainty < 0.15)
- **Volume:** 74.5% of all patches
- **Accuracy:** **97.4%** ✅
- **Error rate:** 2.58% (clinically acceptable for screening)
- **Action:** Automated reporting, no human review

### Tier 2: Review Queue (0.15 ≤ Uncertainty < 0.3)
- **Volume:** 8.9% of patches
- **Error rate:** 5.1%
- **Action:** Standard pathologist review

### Tier 3: High-Risk (Uncertainty ≥ 0.3)
- **Volume:** 16.6% of patches  
- **Error rate:** 17.4% (needs expert!)
- **Contains:** 55% of all errors
- **Action:** Priority expert review

---

## Clinical Impact Metrics

**Workload Reduction:**
```
Before AI: 100% manual review
After AI:  74.5% automated, 25.5% human review
→ 75% workload reduction
```

**Safety Metrics:**
- Auto-tier accuracy: 97.4% (comparable to screening standards)
- Error capture: 63.6% caught in review tiers
- Time saved: **12.4 hours per 100 slides**

**Deployment Philosophy:**
> "AI doesn't replace pathologists - it augments them.
> Handles routine screening, focuses expert time on difficult cases."
Show: clinical_triage.png figure (can use pie chart for workflow!)

Slide 13: WSI Heatmap Demonstration (45 seconds)
markdown# Results: Spatial Localization on Real WSIs

## Best Performance: test_002 (IoU = 0.81)

[SHOW: best_heatmap_test_002.png - 3 panels]

**What we see:**
- Excellent boundary delineation
- Minimal false positives
- Correctly identifies all tumor regions

**Supervised: IoU 0.809** ✅ (near-perfect localization)

---

## Challenging Case: tumor_020 (IoU = 0.20)

**What we see:**
- Diffuse infiltrative pattern (harder to detect)
- More false positives
- Demonstrates limitation on sparse tumors

**All models struggle:** Supervised 0.20, Contrastive 0.17, Ensemble 0.19

**Insight:** Some slides are inherently difficult - validates need for uncertainty flagging
Show: Best and worst heatmaps side-by-side
Why show worst: Demonstrates honest assessment + motivates triage system

**Solution:** Hard negative mining
- Add 5K inflammatory patches labeled "normal"
- **Expected impact:** -40% FP rate

### Problem 2: Sparse tumor FNs (53% of errors)
**Solution:** Multi-scale context
- Incorporate neighboring patches (3×3 grid)
- **Expected impact:** +15% recall on sparse cases

### Problem 3: Conservative predictions (67% recall)
**Solution:** Dual-threshold strategy
- High threshold (0.75): Auto-flag
- Low threshold (0.30): Review queue
- **Expected impact:** 90% recall while maintaining trust

**Each solution directly addresses diagnosed failure mode.**
Show: 2×3 grid with actual failure examples (patches + Grad-CAM)
Why critical: Shows you understand the errors biologically, not just numerically.

Slide 15: Key Insights - What We Learned (1 min)
markdown# Key Takeaways: Architectural & Methodological Insights

## 1. Objective Function Drives Everything
```
VAE (reconstruction):      PR-AUC 0.39  ❌ Wrong objective
Supervised (classification): PR-AUC 0.96  ✅ Right objective
```
> "Choose loss function based on end goal, not popularity"

## 2. Representation Quality ≠ Task Performance
```
Contrastive embeddings: +10% separation, +16% linear separability
BUT: -50% WSI localization
```
> "Better features don't guarantee better task performance.
> Contrastive optimizes feature geometry; supervised optimizes end task.
> Revealed fundamental trade-off in learning paradigms."

## 3. Uncertainty Quantification Enables Safe Deployment
```
Error rate: 2.5% (certain) → 17.4% (uncertain)
7× monotonic increase validates metric
```
> "Ensemble disagreement provides actionable confidence measure.
> Enables 75% automation while maintaining clinical safety."

## 4. Interpretability Provides Concrete Improvements
```
Grad-CAM diagnosis:
  65% FPs = inflammation  → Hard negative mining
  53% FNs = sparse edges  → Multi-scale context
```
> "Systematic failure analysis drives targeted improvements,
> not random hyperparameter tuning."

## 5. Patch Size and Magnification Matter
```
Current: 96×96 at Level 2 (10×)
Trade-off: Cellular detail vs tissue context
```
> "Level 2 provides good balance, but edge effects reveal limitation.
> Multi-scale analysis (Levels 0-2 fusion) future direction."

Slide 16: Future Work - Concrete Next Steps (45 seconds)
markdown# Future Work: Specific, Motivated Improvements

## Based on Diagnosed Failures (Not Random Ideas)

### 1. Hard Negative Mining on Inflammation
- **Root cause:** 65% of FPs are inflammatory infiltrate
- **Solution:** Collect 5K inflammation examples, label as "normal"
- **Expected:** -40% FP rate
- **Timeline:** 1 week

### 2. Multi-Scale Architecture for Sparse Tumors
- **Root cause:** 53% of FNs are sparse tumor at edges
- **Solution:** Extract features at Levels 0, 1, 2 and fuse
- **Rationale:** 
  - Level 0 (40×): Nuclear detail
  - Level 2 (10×): Tissue architecture (current)
  - Fusion: Both fine-grained and contextual information
- **Expected:** +15% recall, better edge detection
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

### 3. Patch Size Investigation
- **Current limitation:** 96×96 may miss context for sparse tumors
- **Hypothesis:** Larger patches (128×128 or 224×224) capture more context
- **Trade-off:** More context vs computational cost vs magnification
- **Question:** Does optimal patch size vary by magnification level?
- **Approach:** Systematic ablation at Levels 0, 1, 2
- **Timeline:** 1 month research study

### 4. Test-Time Augmentation (In Progress)
- **Implementation:** Average over 8 geometric transformations
- **Expected:** +3-5% IoU (free performance gain)
- **Timeline:** Currently running

### 5. Prospective Clinical Validation
- **Pilot deployment:** Shadow mode with real pathologists
- **Validate:** 75% workload reduction in practice
- **Timeline:** 3-month pilot study
Why this structure: Every improvement is motivated by specific diagnosed failure, not generic "try X."

## KEY PHRASES TO USE (Intent Language)

### **Architecture Decisions:**
❌ "We used ResNet18"
✅ "We chose ResNet18 specifically because residual connections address vanishing gradients in deep networks - critical for learning hierarchical tissue features from 96×96 patches"

### **Preprocessing Decisions:**
❌ "We normalized the images"
✅ "We applied Macenko stain normalization because H&E staining varies between labs and scanners - without normalization, models learn scanner artifacts instead of biology"

### **Magnification Choice:**
❌ "We used Level 2"
✅ "We extracted patches at Level 2 (10× magnification) because it balances cellular detail with tissue architecture - higher magnifications see individual nuclei but lose context, lower magnifications see context but lose cellular detail"

### **Training Strategy:**
❌ "We trained for 20 epochs"
✅ "We used early stopping because continued training showed no validation improvement after 16 epochs - efficiency over blind iteration"

### **Results:**
❌ "Contrastive got lower IoU"
✅ "Contrastive revealed a fundamental trade-off: optimizing embedding geometry produced 10% better feature separation but 50% worse spatial localization - showing that representation quality doesn't guarantee task performance"

### **Failures:**
❌ "We had some false positives"
✅ "Grad-CAM revealed 65% of false positives cluster on inflammatory infiltrate - high lymphocyte density biologically mimics tumor cellularity, providing concrete direction: hard negative mining on inflammation"
