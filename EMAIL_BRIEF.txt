Subject: β-VAE for Tumor Detection - Training Update & Results

Hi [Team],

Quick update on the β-VAE project for unsupervised tumor detection in histopathology:

=== CURRENT STATUS ===

✅ Successfully fixed posterior collapse in VAE training
✅ Implemented validation monitoring (85/15 train/val split)  
✅ B1 baseline experiment currently running (20 epochs, ~3hrs total)

Early results (epoch 5):
• Train Loss: 0.058 | Val Loss: 0.047 (generalizing well!)
• KL Divergence: 11.5 nats (healthy, no collapse)
• Latent space active and meaningful

=== KEY TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS ===

1. **Prevented Posterior Collapse**
   - KL capacity scheduling (0→120 nats)
   - Skip connection dropout (25%)
   - Denoising regularization (σ=0.03)

2. **Fixed Loss Computation**
   - SSIM now computed correctly in [0,1] space
   - Proper gradient flow for reconstruction

3. **Validation Monitoring**
   - 22K held-out patches for model selection
   - Prevents overfitting
   - Train/val curves plotted every epoch

=== ARCHITECTURE ===

• Model: VAE-Skip96 (U-Net style, 5.7M params)
• Latent: Spatial 64×3×3 (576 dims)
• Loss: 0.6*L1 + 0.4*(1-SSIM) + β*max(KL-C, 0)
• Data: 147K PCam normal patches → detect tumors in CAMELYON16

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Complete B1 training (ETA: today)
2. Generate tumor heatmaps & compute metrics (AUC-ROC, PR-AUC, F1, IoU)
3. Run ablations: β=3.0, z_dim=128, no denoising, Mahalanobis scoring
4. Compare with transfer learning (ResNet18) & equivariant models (P4M)

Happy to discuss results, architecture choices, or next experiments!

Best,
